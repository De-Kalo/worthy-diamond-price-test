# worthy-diamond-price-test
| FullStack Assignment
Dear Candidate, 

This exercise will test if you are Worthy material, as well as your Fullstack skills and overall drive.






The Task: 


As a marketplace for luxury goods, we want to be able to price items automatically. 

For simplicity purposes, you can assume that the only item type being sold through Worthy is a diamond. Diamonds can be categorized by their Carat Weight, Cut, Color and Clarity. Build a generic feature that lets the user pass diamond characteristics and returns the final price according to them.

Bonus:
This calculator is needed for our next board meeting to show our investors our pricing engine. They need to be able to get a price for a specific diamond and see all similar diamonds and their prices.
Besides calculation, show a link that opens a popup with up to 4 similar items (photo and price).
General Instructions 

● Server Side: should be done in NodeJS.


● Client Side: Create a client side representation of the feature.


● You can make common assumptions if needed, just mention them in your submission.
